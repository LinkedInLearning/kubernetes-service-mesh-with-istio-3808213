## Course Description

<p>In this course, master the deployment and management of a service mesh using Istio’s new ambient mesh mode within a Kubernetes environment. Bukola Johnson introduces the Istio architecture and key components, then installs and configures Istio on a Kubernetes cluster in ambient mode.</p><p>
 Learn how ambient mesh simplifies service mesh adoption by removing sidecar proxies while maintaining security, traffic control, and observability Learn to manage microservices traffic with advanced routing rules, secure service-to-service communication with mutual TLS and authorization policies, and utilize observability tools for monitoring and tracing. Hands-on exercises show you how to configure traffic management features like canary releases and fault injection, and optimize Istio for performance, scalability, and security—all without the overhead of sidecars. 
</p><P>Check out this course to become more adept at deploying a robust service mesh, ensuring the reliability, security, and efficiency of your microservices architecture. </p>
